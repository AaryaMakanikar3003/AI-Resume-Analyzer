        "q": "How is this resume",
        "a": "**Accurate ATS Score:** 72\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\nThe ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score is calculated based on various factors, including keyword matching, format, and content relevance. Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the provided resume:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. **Keyword matching:** The resume contains relevant keywords from the job description, such as \"Operating Systems,\" \"Object Oriented Programming,\" \"Database Management System,\" and \"Algorithms and Data Structures.\"\n2. **Achievements:** The resume highlights the candidate's achievements, such as their role as Coordinator, E-Cell and their performance in the LeetCode contest.\n3. **Education:** The resume provides a clear and concise education history, including the candidate's degree, institution, and CGPA.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. **Summary/Objective:** The resume lacks a professional summary or objective statement, which is a crucial section that provides an overview of the candidate's experience, skills, and career goals.\n2. **Work experience:** The resume only mentions a single achievement in the \"Coordinator, E-Cell\" role, but it does not provide a detailed description of the candidate's responsibilities, accomplishments, or achievements in this role.\n3. **Skills:** The \"Skills\" section is too concise and lacks specific examples or certifications.\n4. **Format:** The resume's format is not visually appealing, and the sections are not clearly labeled.\n\n**Answer to the Question:**\n\nThe resume is a good start, but it lacks a clear professional summary/objective statement, detailed work experience, and specific examples of skills.

        "q": "This is my resume pls tell its ats score and how can i improve it",
        "a": "**ATS Score:** 72/100\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Format and Structure:** The resume has a clear and organized structure with separate sections for education, skills, and achievements. However, some of the sections are not properly formatted, which may cause issues with ATS. I would suggest using a more consistent font and spacing throughout the document.\n2. **Keyword Usage:** The resume lacks relevant keywords from the industry, which may hinder its visibility in ATS. I would recommend incorporating keywords like \"problem-solving,\" \"software development,\" \"data analysis,\" and \"cloud computing\" to improve its chances of being filtered through.\n3. **Quantifiable Achievements:** While the resume mentions some achievements, they are not quantifiable. For example, the mention of being under 20 rank on Coding Ninjas is not specific, and the link provided is not a direct link to the achievement. I would suggest providing more specific and quantifiable achievements to make the resume more impressive.\n4. **Action Verbs:** The resume lacks action verbs, which are essential for highlighting achievements and responsibilities. I would recommend using action verbs like \"developed,\" \"designed,\" \"managed,\" and \"improved\" to describe skills and achievements.\n5. **Relevance:** The resume mentions some irrelevant information, such as the date of birth and the school's name. I would suggest removing such information to make the resume more concise and relevant.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1. Use a consistent font and spacing throughout the document.\n2. Incorporate relevant industry keywords.\n3. Quantify achievements by providing specific numbers and metrics.\n4. Use action verbs to describe skills and achievements.\n5.
